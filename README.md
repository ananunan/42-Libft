# 📚 Libft: Your Personal C Library Adventure! 🌟

Welcome to **Libft**, where C becomes a little less cryptic and a lot more fun! 💻✨  
This project is your chance to build a library of essential functions that will be your loyal coding companion through thick and thin.  

---

## 🌟 **What is Libft?**  
Think of it as your very own Swiss Army knife 🛠️ for C programming:  
- **Reimplement standard C library functions** like `strlen`, `strcpy`, and `atoi`.  
- **Create new tools** like linked lists and memory manipulators.  
- **Learn to love Makefiles**, because they make life easier (promise)!  

---

## 🛠️ **Features**
Here’s what you’ll find in your shiny new library:  
- **Memory Manipulation**: `ft_memset`, `ft_bzero`, `ft_calloc`, etc.  
- **String Operations**: `ft_strncmp`, `ft_strdup`, `ft_strjoin`—your stringy BFFs!  
- **Character Checks**: `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, and more!  
- **Linked Lists**: `ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd_front`, and other linked list magic.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ananunan/42-Libft.git
   cd 42-Libft
   
2. Compile the library:
`make`

3. Call functions and watch them work wonders! 🌈


## 🌸 **Why You'll Love Libft**

You’ll reinvent the wheel and truly understand how it rolls.

It’s the foundation of many future 42 projects (hello, ft_printf 👋).

You’ll become one with Makefiles, and that’s a superpower. 💪
